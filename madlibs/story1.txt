Jason Mraz - "I'm Yours (with a little creative license on the lyrics!)"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well you've done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I <First up: I need a past tense verb...>
I fell right through the <Next, gimme a cool plural noun...>
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but <Right on! An adjective?> <Aaaaaaand an exotic animal, plural! :D>
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your <Great, nice one! Now, I need a body part, singular...> and see like me

Open up your <And another singular body part pleease?> and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment people <And now, gimme a present tense verb...>
and <One more of those, please. :)>,
we're just one big <Go wild and throw in a singular noun that has to do with French cuisine!>
It's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure

There's no need to <A verb, I say! Gimme a present tense verb! :)>
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
Do you want to, come on, scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your <Ooo, and another singular noun - but this time, let's make it something you keep next to your bed! :D>

I've been spending way too long <I'm looking for another interesting verb, with an '-ing' at the end.>
my <To keep it interesting, gimme another singular noun - the last thing you'd ever eat!> in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new <One more singular noun - this time, what's the last gift you got?> and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of <I need two plural nouns: First one is your call... have fun with it! :D>
and just go with the <For the second plural noun: What's the name of Willy Wonka's newest creation? (Remember, make it plural!)>
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
