JasonMraz:
Well you've done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I []
I fell right through the []
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but [] []
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your [] and see like me

Open up your [] and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment people [] and [], we're just one big []
It's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure

There's no need to []
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
Do you want to, come on, scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your []

I've been spending way too long [] my [] in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new [] and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of []
and just go with the []
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
