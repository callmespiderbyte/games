advents:
  00: Day 1 | Kicking this off with something fun, interesting, a clever idea, idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ thought it was kinda cool though > http://tholman.com/abstract-clocks/
  01: Day 5 | This song is pretty funny (and kinda catchy??) > www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwBFtFBrdeQ
  02: Day 23 | You'll be away for out actual 6 month anniversary - sooo today is close enough? Be ready at 6pm! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ xx
  03: Day 16 | Did you know... Australia is wider than the moon, it rains diamonds on Jupiter, and from when it was discovered to when it was declassified as a planet, Pluto did not make a full orbit around the sun!
  04: Day 11 | In case you're having a tough or busy week, or even if you aren't, this place is pretty cool > www.bit.ly/2QEYa9Q
  05: Day 2 | “The world makes much less sense than you think. The coherence comes mostly from the way your mind works.” ― Daniel Kahneman
  10: Day 13 | Ok, I know I said no 'novelty gifts' BUT if you text me the secret password correctly (see ridde at end), you'll get a clue on where to find today's thing. Here's the riddle - What gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?
  11: Day 9 | Hope you have/had a good start to the week dude =) Today's message is just a reminder that I'm here for you, and that I love you ❤️
  12: Day 7 | Go here ( > www.weavesilk.com), draw these 3 things, and please show me! ^_^ 1) a blueberry ice cream, 2) a creeper, 3) what your house-spaceship would look like if you were going to travel the galaxy.
  13: Day 20 | Today's a little different, for a change. Gratitude is super important, and I know I don't practise it explicitly often enough. So, just think of 3 things that you're really, genuinely grateful for. Imagine life without them, think on what they've brought into your life, and what you'd do if, tomorrow, they weren't there anymore. Nothing tragic or depressing - keep it positive, and just think fondly!
  14: Day 10 | Quite a fun site to click through - let me know if you find anything interesting? > www.theuselessweb.com
  15: Day 12 | "No solution can ever be found by running in three different directions." - Deepak Chopra
  20: Day 3 | Did you know... When Markus Persson kicked off Minecraft's development process, he referred to the project as “Cave Game.” The name was soon changed to "Minecraft, Order of the Stone", and, ultimately, just "Minecraft." (I think the middle one sound super cool ='D haha)
  21: Day 18 | A little reminder > www.bit.ly/2QLPMFl
  22: Day 24 | ...aaand we're at the end! =D Instead of another link or surprise or quote, thought I'd leave you with this... If I'm a series of atomic reactions, in a constant state of change, and some of my cells regenerate every day, or every few weeks, so that I never wake up 100% the same biologically as I was the day before, then it makes sense why I haven't stopped falling in love you over and over again, every time I see you. And I don't want that to ever stop. xx
  23: Day 4 | You're cute. Like, very cute. The only thing (a)cuter than you is a triangle with angles less than 90 degrees (kidding - obtuse you're cuter than that!)
  24: Day 14 | Did you know... Creepers were a coding error! Markus Persson didn’t actually set out to design such a monster. He was trying to create a pig, but accidentally switched the figures for desired height and length when inputting the code. The result was the monstrosity that players know and love.
  25: Day 6 | You may have already seen this, but it's a game that tears apart sites with bad UI - fun to go as far as you can (but fucking irritating, be warned, haha)> www.userinyerface.com/game.html
  30: Day 21 | Hm... how's about you surprise me today? ;)
  31: Day 19 | This is one of my favourite podcasts, and I wanted to share an episode that stands out in memory as really profound for me at the time I listened to it > www.bit.ly/2OKknR4
  32: Day 8 | What did the scientist say when he found 2 isotopes of helium? “HeHe”
  33: Day 15 | Turns out coding and art complement each other pretty well - hopefully you enjoy exploring the ideas and projects on this site! (pro-tip... watch the landing page intro video) > www.devart.withgoogle.com
  34: Day 17 | A song I'd like to sing with you > www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1Evnzkez7o
  35: Day 22 | Nearly the end of this advent calendar! EEK! Jomiro buys Dan some dark chocolate - it's super effective! (please leave me some I've genuinely keen to taste this one ='D will give it to you when I see ya!)
